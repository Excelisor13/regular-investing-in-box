## 3. The one and only correct way for ordinary people to invest is Regular Investing

Let me show you the conclusion first:

> In this magical place of exchange market, **the only correct way for ordinary people to invest is regular investing**- keep this in mind!

Since [BOX](https://b.watch), the first blockchain ETF in this world, has just been established (July 3, 2019, the so-called “seven-three leek festival” which is the “Double-Eleven Festival” of the blockchain world) and its data is not sufficient enough, BOX cannot be used as the modeling example to explain the only reliable way of investing for ordinary person, i.e. regular investing.

The predecessor of the [Longmen Fund](http://www.longmen.fund/) (https://longmen.fund) was the Bit Fund, which was founded by Li Xiaolai in 2013. It was liquidated in 2018. Since some investors decided to continue after its liquidation, the ETF product, Longmen Fund, was created. The Longmen Fund is not open to the public. Currently, only a small number of qualified investors are invited to invest in Longmen Fund.... However, because it has long-term transparent data, it can be used here as an example of regular investing.

The following is a screenshot of the Longmen Fund website in early July of 2019:

In order to use this data as an example of regular investing, we only take a look at the data for each month:

![longmen.smiling.curve.tb](../images/longmen.smiling.curve.tb.png)

Suppose you started investing from September 2018 and invested $1,000 per month in Longmen Capital and continued for 11 months... Then, the data is more or less as follows:

Which means if you invest regularly on a monthly basis, you will miss the highest point, $92 on June 25, 2019; you will also miss the lowest point, $23 on December 15, 2018... But, in the end your average price is $54, and the current price is around $85. After 11 months, you have invested a total of $11,000; and your current book value is $19,141.44 - even if it is based on the price of the installment of the investment you made the very last time, $82 - which is $1 less than that of from the previous month... However, your yield rate is **74.01%** !

Looking at the picture below, you can see more clearly the relationship between the principal you invested and the current yield:

In the 11-month data of the above Longmen Fund, the price curve draws a fascinating “smile curve”.

The people who adopt the Regular Investing strategy in the market are always a minority, and the so-called " smile curve " above is very likely to be a diametrically opposite " wretched curve " for those who have not adopted the Regular Investing strategy. It is definitely not a kind smile, but the evil smile of the clown you saw in the Batman story - his mouth is gloomy saying: "Why so serious?"

Now take another look at the data, assuming that your investment method is the kind that most people love to do, the so-called "a shuttle"... Then, in September 2018, you invested $11,000 one-off and after 11 months, you had no loss, because you will have about **10.81%** proceeds! —— Although it is much worse than **74.01%** , but it's better than at loss!

However, based on the nature of your special love for shuttling, the possibility that you can keep it for 11 months is actually pretty low. why? For a shuttler, this curve is definitely a wretched curve.

Let alone you will suffer agony and anxiety in the next month, you will suffer every moment for the every following day. For the next six months, your only feeling is that your assets are shrinking every minute.

Pain and happiness are not symmetrical. Our genes determine our feelings. The pain of losing 10 dollars is far greater than the happiness of earning 10 dollars. You feel absolutely like you are being smashed by the evil clown, and watching him spit out his tongue, listening to his gloomy mutter, why so serious...

If you are an investor adopting the Regular Investing approach, you are in a completely different world – although they look exactly the same, although most people except you can’t understand your feelings because all the feelings are the opposite.

** Regular Investing is the behavior which requires your own future to support**. So, since you have gambled on your own future, you must have thought it through when you chose. Therefore, the fall of the price and every fall after your first purchase lowers your average price. Shuttlers are there suffering from the cold winter, shivering, but you are the opposite, you are refreshed, you are happy for having more low-priced chips...

A shuttler can't stand the pain for too long - in fact, no one can endure suffering for a long time. This has nothing to do with the so-called "strong". From another point of view, this is not stupid, it is just ignorance. After a month of pain, or two months, or three months, or even longer when it was going to over looking back, which is, in the sixth month (or before), most people will quit based on various reasons - This kind of behavior is called "cutting meat" in the trading market... You see, the leek is cutting itself, and it's bloody meat that they cut.

What about you who adopted regular investing? Are you hanging on? No! It should be like that! If during this process, someone stops you buying low-priced chips, you will fight with him - blocking people's way to wealth. It's like murdering their parents. Don't you agree? Are you cold? Are you shivering? You can't feel it! You are excited, every time you invest an installment, you are excited, because every time the average price is reduced is equivalent to "**moving your admission time forward**" - you will not be as annoyed as many half-brainers every day, "Hey! Only if I knew this earlier!" Or "How could I know?" They all think that they are late... You are different, you know that your behavior is constantly moving your relative admission time forward.

Six months later, the price began to climb slowly... Do you think that people who left the market by cuttingmeat will rush into this shuttle at this time? No. They are afraid to death - the experience of suffering will make their expectations of fear stronger. So, almost 100% they will hesitate, and they will be watching the price rise with no chips in hand... When the price fell, they run because they wer terrified to death, and now they are more terrified when the price rise. — Until they collapse, and the price may be already pretty high. When the next wretched curve is forming, they enter the market...

For them, cycle is terrible, because no matter what they do, they feel they are in a malicious world. With the explanation above, it is very simple to explain. For them, the price curve of any investment target is composed of countless wretched curves. How terrible such a fate is?

You see, in one world, people may feel the opposite; isn't that amazing? If you are a person adopting the Regular Investing strategy, then, with the blink of an eye, this world shows you a total different picture, because the price curve you face is composed of countless smile curves! In this world, happiness is inherently rare and scarce. Isn't this kind of happiness that cannot be expressed with words more scarce and more precious?
