## 2. The stock exchange market is the ninth wonder of the world

There are many types of investable targets, such as gold, antiques, art, real estate, early startups, and listed companies... Maybe you don’t know that in the highly developed financial world, even trendy shoes are investable subject.

However, here we are talking about investment, particularly the automatic investment, which means:

> **Stocks of listed companies that are available for purchase and trade on the trading market, or those tradable blockchain digital assets that are purchasable in the developing next generation of stock exchanges.**

In my opinion, the traditional **stock exchange market** is definitely worthy of being called **the ninth wonder** of the world. In addition to the recognized seven wonders of the world, Einstein once called " **complex interest** " **the eighth wonder of the world** .

The stock exchange market provides an excellent opportunity for ordinary people. What opportunity? **The opportunity to get rid of class solidification.**

Why do you say that? We are attracted to all kinds of entrepreneurial stories every day, because the protagonist in the story is said to be from the grassroots but eventually completes the transformation, becoming the founder, leader of a unicorn, or the chairman of a listed company... These protagonists are no longer restricted by the problem of hierarchy solidification; but the problem is that this is not a good path for ordinary people. Since the facts have proved that they can create such great business value, then they are not ordinary people - they are extremely talented people. Whether they are from grassroots or not, whether they are poor in the beginning or not, success itself is proof that they are inherently successful people. Subsequent discussions will also allow you to clearly see a cold fact:

> Even those who are so talented and workharding, the ultimate success depends more on luck - they have to have enough good luck to get the support of the trend.

Even if you work at a listed company, luck still has something to do with you to some extent. It is definitely luck to join in the early days of a company that can be listed in the future. However, if you look at the examples, you will understand that when the company goes public, the probability of keeping up with the concept, ability, and relationship and being put in an important position is actually extremely low. Before the listing of this excellent company, even if getting a job there is not something that ordinary people can do. Your age shall be just right, your education shall be sufficient, and your ability shall be just right for the company... You may ask those working in a listed company and then you will understand that in addition to the pressure, how many of them actually hold the company's stock? Without the company's stock, no matter how hard you try, the company's development has almost nothing to do with you.

However, with the existence of stock exchanges, no matter who you are - regardless of nationality, region, race, gender, age, height, weight or sexual orientation - — You can buy the stocks of the best companies in the world any time, and let your money grow with the best companies in the world 24 hours a day non-stop – this is the true meaning of “fighting” ! What's especially striking is that under normal circumstances, as investors, these ordinary people do not need to do anything else! The most amazing thing is that buying stocks of the best companies in the world has almost no threshold!

Ordinary people's money is unlikely to have any effective value-added opportunities, because ordinary people find it difficult to create real business value. Only a very small amount of people in the world are trying their best to create business value in order to change their own destiny, and finally succeeded. Enterprises in the stock exchange market, although there are also garbage companies, are all enterprises that are strictly selected based on certain standards. Most of the people in the world who are really good at creating business value are in the listed companies.

As long as ordinary people buy the stocks of good companies with their own money, it means that ordinary people are instantly upgraded to bosses, and those who create business value most are working for these ordinary people - even though those ordinary people most certainly are incompetent bosses.

People always think that "choose stocks" is a very difficult thing - in fact, it is not difficult at all ! Because the so-called "difficulties" are entirely caused by inertial thinking. In fact, it is the result that people are unwilling or afraid to use the simplest, rudest and the most effective method. The method is too simple to be believable:

> **Just choose the stocks that everyone in the market is most optimistic about.**

Pay attention to the word "most". In Shenzhen Stock Exchange, you just buy Vanke; in Shanghai Stock Exchange, you just buy Guizhou Moutai; on Nasdaq, you just buy Apple; at Hong Kong Stock Exchange, you just buy Tencent; in blockchain exchange, you just buy BitCoin……

This is the essence of the magic of the trading market – here, **you can use the wisdom of others.**

As you have seen just now, ordinary people can make the best people in the world's best companies help them make money even with very little money! Do you know what is more magical? It's you can make the smartest people in the entire market choose investment items for you. You think you can't do it? You think you don't understand it? You think you are stupid? You think you need to spend a lot of time to learn even if you are not stupid? In fact, you are overthinking, because these are not important - don't you admire Buffett? Then you go directly to buy the stock of the company he is holding, which is equivalent to let Buffett think for you for free... Of course, Buffett is not necessarily the best, then what should you do? You can you select the target that everyone is optimistic about. This is what I just said, Vanke, Maotai, Apple, Tencent, and Bitcoin are the varieties that the smartest people on the market have already chosen for you – and the advice of these smartest people is completely free!

No need to doubt this zero-cost judgment. If the most optimistic target in the whole market failed in the end, you have nothing to complain about - because that is already the best advice! Likewise, when China Tobacco was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2019, you just buy! Because that is the most cash-producing company in China!

Guess what is the most amazing? This simplest, most straightforward, rudest and absolutely effective method is not adopted by 99% of investors! If you look at the data, you will realize how amazing this "most amazing" is. According to the statistics of March 31, 2019, the total number of shareholders of Kweichow Moutai (600519) was 80,594. During the same period, the number of open accounts in China's stock market was about 150 million... around five over ten thousand investors purchased Moutai. And there are many institutional investors, which means, among ordinary people, perhaps only less than one in ten thousand investors have the gut to use this simple, straightforward but extremely effective principle.

If you choose the most optimistic investment item on the market, do you have any idea what the effect of this is 
? You no longer need to research or analyze or pay attention to the chart. You don't even need to discuss with anyone at all; in fact, you don't have to do anything, because it's all done by the smartest people on the market, and FOR FREE!!! - This is definitely the highest level of investors in the modern trading market. Rumor has said that the life of Maotai shareholders is also very simple, which is just reading, working out, traveling, and spending time with their family... This is true indeed.

So, shouldn't the stock exchange market be called the ninth wonder of the world? Whichever it is, anyway, it is a miraculous existence.

If the traditional stock exchange market can be called the ninth wonder of the world, then the blockchain trading market must be called the tenth wonder of the world. The blockchain exchange is a subversive version of the traditional stock exchange market – you can see the amazing subversion from a single point:

> - There are already tens of thousands of blockchain digital asset exchanges around the world;
> - They form a trading kingdom that is trading every day, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, never stops;
> - The future traders come from all over the world...

Apple is now a trillion-dollar company. In the past 52 weeks, the daily trading volume of Apple stocks was 28,834,582. Based on the price of July 2019, the daily trading value of Apple stock is about 5.77 billion dollar.

The circulation market value of Bitcoin as of July 10, 2019 was about $224.7 billion, less than a quarter of Apple's; however, Bitcoin's day trading volume was $29.47 billion, five times the amount of Apple's stock trading. Moreover, this difference is not ordinarily big, right? And the market value of only more than 5 billion US dollars EOS is only 1 / 200 of Apple's market value, but how much is its daily trading volume? $2.3 billion, approaching 1/2 of Apple’s stock trading volume... Isn't that amazing? In the foreseeable future, this difference can only grow bigger and bigger.

This explains why blockchain digital assets are more worth investing than stocks if the stocks are more worthwhile investing than bonds.
