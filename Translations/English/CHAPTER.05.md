## 5. Why are there so few people using this magical strategy?

At this point, you must have become more and more curious, or even simply suspicious:

> If this regular investing strategy is so magical that it's the only way to escape class solidification for ordinary people, why do so few people adopt this strategy? !

First of all, let us look at an obvious fact:

> In China, most families are working around the clock conducting regular investment!

In fact, all over the world, it's pretty much the same case... However, for the vast majority of people, this regular investment is realty. What does this say? Virtually everyone has the ability to invest regularly.

Unfortunately, people all over the world are deceived by banks – spending the most productive twenty or thirty years of their lives investing in realty regularly paying huge interest for bank loans and live the life of a slave.

Most of these people call themselves "house slaves" - even when the economy is good, buying a house is not a good experience. In essence, they are not slaves to the house, they are slaves to the bank. It’s terrible to say it in essence. These house slaves have never seriously examined the truth which is:

> What they actually are doing is they spend the most productive years of their life paying the amount of two houses for only one house - the sum of interest on mortgages in the past two or three decades is always the same as the value of the property. This is the job of bank's actuaries.

You don't get mad without comparison.

You and your classmate made different choices 18 years ago, while you chose to buy a house by loan; your classmate chose to invest in Moutai stocks - he is a fool, so he can only use the free advice of the smartest people on the market... 18 years later, what happens?

Suppose the house you bought is located in Beijing. The increase of the property price in Beijing is the highest in the country these years. The annual compound growth is about 18%. After rounding off, the value of your property that has increased in the past 18 years is 20 times! Amazing! However, in fact, it is not so optimistic. Because you need to pay interest, it is equivalent to buying a property twice the price, so your gain is 10 times instead of 20. Also, it's only 18 years, the loan is 30 years in total. In the first few years, you paid off the principal, but at least half of the interest has not been paid yet which means your gain is only 3/4 of the 10 times, i.e. 7.5 times... This is the scenario when you entered the market before the house price sky-rockets! Those who only started investing regularly in real estate in 2018, even looking into 2036, can't except a return that high.

Now let's see how your classmate was doing. The stock of Moutai in his hands has grown 180 times in the past 18 years! This is equivalent to an annual compound growth of 33.45%! And your stupid classmate didn't invest all at once at the lowest price at the very beginning, but invested regularly during these 18 years. Then, his gain will not be as much as 180 times, but it is definitely about 40 times. ......

This comparison is pretty harsh, right? In fact, it is even more devestating that it can suffocate you:

> - Your property is indeed an asset, but its liquidity is close to zero;
> - The stock of your classmate is also  an asset, but its liquidity is almost 100%...

**For assets, liquidity is the decisive factor.** If the liquidity is zero, no matter how valuable the assets are, it is pretty much like that you have bullets in your pistol when facing the enemy, but the bullets are stuck in the cartridge holder ... This is the real reason why the gains of your stupid classmate is rock-hard 40 times. Because the liquidity of his assets is perfect!

Although this comparison is really irritating, it probably won't happen, because the greater probability is that your stupid classmate is very unlikely to invest in Moutai stocks regularly – in fact, in the past 18 years, there are only a handful of people who invested in Moutai stocks regularly. It's very rare for such a tragedy to happen around you...

Why? Because **Regular Investing** is actually a societial behavior, even a social behavior.

Your idiotic friend won't have a future that makes you angry and desperate. Most likely, his fate should be similar to yours, because you are both social animals. You all live in the same society, and you are all under strong societial influence... You needs to get married, and he needs to get married, right? Why do you need to buy a house? That is not your idea but the idea of your monther-in-law's. If you do not have a house, your mother-in-law will not marry her daughter to you! Do you think your idiotic classmate's mother-in-law is any different? ninty percent of the probability is exactly no. Most mothers in this society will not marry their daughter to a man who can't afford to buy a house. It's not their fault. Everyone is the same!

This is why in the big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, most people are debtors. They do worth tens of millions including real estate, but their pockets are empty. They have few disposable cash and they have large amounts of interest to pay to the banks every month. It would be worse if they have kids and it keeps going worse if their property is located in a school district. Although they are definitely not poor considerting they own property, their life is miserable squezzing in a nest of dozen or twenty square meters.

The strategy of regular investing includes the following points:

> - What is the investment item?
> - How long is long-term?
> - What is the interval of regular?
> - What is the minimum amount of each investment?
> - What should I do if in the event of surprises?

You have enormous societial drive to regular invest in real estate - you don't even need to think about the item; Bank's actuaries have figured the long-term for you, and people don't care about all these who have unconsciously began to invest regularly, because everyone is this: borrowing from the bank, repaying by instalments, usually 30 years ; on a monthly basis; calculate reversely and you have the amount of each investment; for a good house, the amount is high, while for a bad house, the amount is low; what happens when there is an accident? Well, life is always full of surprises, deal with it when it happens! The fact is when there is an accident, even if you borrow money to deal with the accident, you need to pay loan...

The item on the Regular Investing market is different. The consensus of socialization is basically:

> - "Isn't that shaky?"
> - "How risky is that!"
> - "It cann't be true!"
> - "Hey, I just can't figure it out!"

Even more shocking is:

> - "You didn't know? That guy lost all his money in the stock market and jumped from the roof of a building !"

For most people, investing in the stock market is just being speculative and no one ends up good being speculative! That it! As to what is Regular Investing; why conduct regular investing; and how to invest regularly, most people simply don’t know. Because there is no convincing successful examples around.

Under the influence of such powerful socialization, the number of people who choose to invest in stocks or securities regularly can only be very few.

During the process in which the Internet is constantly changing the world, the loneliness people who invest regularly is destined to suffer may be greatly relieved. The emergence and development of the Regular Investing community solved this problem.

Herd mentality is not considered to be a good thing most of the time, but in a few cases, herd mentality also has great benefits. It's like it's hard to exercise regularly at home, so you'd rather pay an annual fee, pay a high personal trainer fee or even go to the gym to exercise even though it's far. It is like even though you can learn all by yourself, but if you are in a class or dorm filled with excellent classmates, you will work more diligently and harder, and be better naturally.

**Joining a regular investing community is no doubt the optimal strategy.** If you want to invest in [BOX](https://b.watch) regularly, you have to join the [b.watch community](https://b.watch). If you want to invest in US stocks or invest in Hong Kong stocks, then you must find a way to join the right quality vertical community online. Why? Because if you are an outsider, it is difficult to understand whatever you said, because even for the same thing, under the same situation, others may hold the opposite opinion or feelings; not being understood might be acceptable, but you may even be despised - isn't that the most unnecessary  loss? Try to feel it!

It’s totally different in the Regular Investing community. You’re a weirdo if you don't invest regularly – this is the major reason why many high-quality communities are quiet. Nothing is more important than knowing that you have companions and you are not alone.
