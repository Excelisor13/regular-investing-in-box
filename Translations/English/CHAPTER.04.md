## 4. Is there any investment item whose price only rises never falls?

As an ordinary person, when you realize the magic of the trading market, find out that there is a way to make the world's smartest people work for you without threshold, and make the world's smartest people help you choose the best investment items for free, although there's no need to be smug, there is absolutely no need to be self-pity at all. Because the vast majority of so-called investors in the trading market are half-baked – even the vast majority of the investment managers in suits are half-wits...

If you don't believe it, I can quickly show you a very effective trick.

Whenever there's a guy who acts like an expert in front of you, you may just ask in a careless way:

> ... How do you dilute the opportunity cost?

In most cases, you will find that his pupils will diverge immediately and he will also start stuttering... Just try it if you don't believe!

When we adopt the free best advice provided by the smartest people on the market, we will face another embarrassment, which is, if we only buy Vanke, or just buy any one of Guizhou Maotai, Apple, Coca-Cola and even Chinese Tobacco, we face a serious problem:

> **The opportunity cost of investing in only one item is infinite!**

This is definitely a concept that any person can understand!

The so-called opportunity cost means that if your money is invested in one item, it cannot be invested in another item... If you invest A with some money, then the money cannot be simultaneously used to invest in B, then B's future gains will be the opportunity cost of the money which you used to invest in A.

If you only invest in one item, then your opportunity cost is infinite! Therefore, even a greenhand can easily understand why it is important to find a way to dilute the opportunity cost! Invesment is a comprehensive thinking technology. You can't just consider the possible rate of return. In addition, you must also consider the risk... And “**how to dilute the opportunity cost**” is also an important factor that must be considered!

Is there a way to dilute the opportunity cost? Certainly! A simple way is to invest in a basket of quality items. When you buy an index fund or an ETF, your investment item is no longer a quality company or project, but a basket of quality companies or projects!

There is a subtle important point which has been overlooked by many people. By purchasing a basket of quality items, you effectively dilute the opportunity cost on one hand, and on the other hand, the attributes and quality of your investment item have changed! **Your investment item has become an item the price of which only rises and never falls in the long run**!

Is it really so amazing? Absolutely!

It is incredibly difficult for high-quality companies to achieve long-term success. Even great companies may decline. Like Kodak and Nokia you must have heard of. Companies such as Coca-Cola and Kweichow Moutai are extremely rare, but they might also encount Black Swan events and suffer from the disaster. Therefore, investing only in one great company, on one hand, has infinitely high opportunity cost; on the other hand, cannot effectively circumvent black swan events. This is especially true if you look at it from a long-term perspective.

However, is there an investment item the price of which only goes up and never falls down in the long run in this world? Yes! That is **the economic development of human mankind**.

This is also why in the long run, the price index of the stock market has only one trend, upward. The short-term ups and downs constitute one after another smiling curves (or wretched curves). When you link all these curves, there is only one trend, upward, even if there are definitely ups and downs in the middle, but eventually, it's upward.

The following is a price trend chart for the S&P 500 index over the past 40 years (1979 to 2019):

Therefore, when you invest in a basket of high-quality items, what you “gamble” on is no longer a certain enterprise. The item of your “gambling” on actually becomes the entirety of economic development... You bought a basket of high quality stocks in the Chinese stock market, then you are actually betting on China's overall economic development! You bought a basket of high-quality items on the US stock market, then you are actually betting on the overall economic development of the world - because great companies from all over the world will go public in the US! You bought a [BOX](https://b.watch) (there are three high-quality assets in the blockchain world, BTC, EOS, XIN), then you are no longer betting on Bitcoin, or a blockchain project. What you actually "gamble" on is the development of the entire blockchain industry.

Therefore, when I was designing the [BOX](https://b.watch), the most important consideration is the development of the blockchain technology. The blockchain technology development route that I have said in many places is:

> Trusted Account Book → Trusted Code → Trusted Execution Environment → Trusted Device...

Historically, I certainly didn't miss Bitcoin in 2011; in 2016, I did not actually miss Ethereum; in 2017, I was an angel investor of EOS, the hottest blockchain project with a market value of more than $5 billion in 2019. Similarly, the MIXIN Network is also a project which I heavily invested in - if it is once or twice, it may be good luck; if it is repeated again and again, or even three or four times, it is not only good luck, right? Logic is the only tool available to humans when facing the future. In this design, there is no secular selfishness, because the designer of [BOX](https://b.watch) Li Xiaolai does not charge management fees (this may be the world's first blockchain ETF that does not charge management fees), and, more importantly, Li Xiaolai may only make money by investing in [BOX](https://b.watch) under the same conditions as everyone else.

In fact, the real magic of the stock exchange market is right here! Here, anyone can keep up with the economic development of the entire human race or society as a whole. The beauty of globalization is that ordinary people in Japan can buy American stocks to keep up with US economic development during the recession of the country; ordinary Americans can buy Chinese stocks when the US economy is stagflation to keep up with China's economic development; even if it is very inconvenient for ordinary Chinese people to buy Japanese stocks or US stocks or even Hong Kong stocks, they can always participate in the world's almost ubiquitous blockchain trading like all ordinary people around the world to keep up with the subversive rise and development of the financial Internet.

There is a hidden important point here:

> There is no investment item that only rises and not falls, but there are items that only rise and do not fall in the long run.

In the book "Self-cultivation for Leeks", I tried to correct a truth that most ordinary people misunderstand:

> - The trading market is indeed a zero-sum game in the real-time trading process - it seems that the opponent's profit comes from and is exactly your loss.
> - The trading market is definitely not a zero-sum game for long-term investors – because their growth is mainly from economic growth rather than short-term losses of others.

This is also the inherent reason why the only reliable investment method for ordinary people in the trading market is Regular Investing. In another word, as an ordinary person, only investing and holding long-term is foolproof.

Most ordinary people don't have a lot of money in the early days. However, by means of Regular Investing, ordinary people "gamble" on their ability to make money outside the market and the long-term regular investing discipline. This is a huge stake! Because your time is an absolutely exclusive asset. It definitely is an asset with an infinite opportunity cost. So, when you use your most valuable, infinite-opportunity-cost asset to invest, you can only choose the item that is foolproof. What is it then? It is the development of the entire economy of mankind. Apart from this, there is no other choice.

Looking from this moment, the blockchain market is better than the stock market; the stock market is better than the real estate market; the real estate market may be better than the bond market; the bond market may be better than bank deposits... and the regular investing is an investment strategy ordinary people adopt when they don't have a lot of money in the beginning so can only stake their own future. Therefore, finding the best possible investment item worth every bit of effort. If at some point in the future, the optimal investment item is no longer the blockchain market, switching to that other optimal item is wise – this is not belief. This is simply pragmatic.

The result of this subtle choosing method will bring a magical feeling to you. You will be amazed at how you find out and understand the facts that most people do not know:

> **The boundary of the clouds floating in the sky is actually irrelevant to the boundaries of the cities on the ground!**

When others are still listening to the weather forecast to know the local weather today, you have already locked your eyes in the sky, and find ways to know in advance which piece or which clouds will cause rain... **The realm** is obviously different! You may even use the fancy word of **level** and not feel it's overrated...

Finally, there are more important key points to add:

> Regular Investing is a long-term continuous investment behavior, so the investment item must meet the "**long-term bullish**" attribute.

Therefore, if you are extremely strict on this attribute, the conclusion is very obvious. Bonds, gold, real estate – not to mention the trendy shoes – are not qualified items because they simply can't satisfy the attribute that must be met. From this perspective, you can immediately understand why Buffett is very careful about technology stocks, but very reassured about Coca-Cola...
